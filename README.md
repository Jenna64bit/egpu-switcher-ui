# egpu-switcher-ui
I was annoyed at not having a UI to pick my GPU. Now I do.

# Requirements
You will need Zenity and egpu-switcher installed and in your path.
This program also assume syou're using lightdm. Switch that with whatever you are actually using.

# Notes
I don't think this is needed with Wayland. Just X11.
I'm no super genius, so there's no warranty.
This program will immediately attempt to restart your X11 session, beware.
